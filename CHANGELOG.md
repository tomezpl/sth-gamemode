# 1.1.0
## Features
- Added player death markers on the radar. Use `setr sth_deathbliplifespan <seconds>` to override the number of seconds the marker stays on the map. ([#26](https://github.com/tomezpl/sth-gamemode/issues/26)) 

# 1.0.1
## Fixes
- Fixed an issue where one player would be consistently excluded from the random hunted pick. The game now operates a queue system to ensure every player waits roughly the same amount of time between their hunted rounds. ([#22](https://github.com/tomezpl/sth-gamemode/issues/22))
